### Dev Note
Previously this repository was on a PlasticSCM repository. However due to some complications, I have "transferred" the progress from that repository to this. This will be the main repository for this particular version of Maestrela.

For some commits, they will have the exact comments that were written for each object in PlasticSCM. The comments will be written in the description of the commit, and the summary of the commit will have the object name of the object in PlasticSCM. The creation date of the object will also be put in the description of the commit. Additional notes (that weren't in the comments in the PlasticSCM) will be written in square brackets [ ].
