# Abstract
Teachers working in the public basic education sector of the Philippines are heavily burdened with numerous tasks and problems that are outside the scope of teaching. They are overworked, and it has negatively affected their personal life, as well as the quality of education they can provide to students. The research aims to create a tower defense game depicting the challenges of a public high school teacher in the Philippines, with the goal of educating players of the situation, and allowing them to empathize with the teachersâ€™ problems. The game is developed using the Unity game engine, and deployed as a browser game that players can playtest. The different levels of the game depict the usual events that occur in a school year, such as preparing for quarterly examinations, and school events. The player must use the available towers, which are depictions of the various tools and equipment that a teacher typically has access to, to defend against the numerous waves in a single level. The playtests showed that the game can teach players the difficulties, heavy workload, and other problems that public high school teachers in the Philippines encounter. It also showed that the game is gives players a positive experience with its simple yet slightly challenging levels and game mechanics.

### Dev Note
Previously this repository was on a PlasticSCM repository. However due to some complications, I have "transferred" the progress from that repository to this. This will be the main repository for this particular version of Maestrela.

For some commits, they will have the exact comments that were written for each object in PlasticSCM. The comments will be written in the description of the commit, and the summary of the commit will have the object name of the object in PlasticSCM. The creation date of the object will also be put in the description of the commit. Additional notes (that weren't in the comments in the PlasticSCM) will be written in square brackets [ ].
