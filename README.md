## Dev Note
The game Maestrela has its "main" repository in PlasticSCM. This repository that
you are seeing is essentially a replica of the PlasticSCM repository that is being used.

This is mainly for backup purposes, in case something goes wrong with the 
PlasticSCM software or license.

Commits will have the exact comments that were written for each object in PlasticSCM. 
The comments will be written in the description of the commit, and the summary of the
commit will have the object name of the object in PlasticSCM.

The creation date of the object will also be put in the description of the commit.
